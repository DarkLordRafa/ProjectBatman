			When his parents were gunned down in front of him, young Bruce
			Wayne resolved to rid Gotham City of the criminal element that took
			their lives.
			He trained extensively to achieve mental and physical perfection, in
			addition to mastering martial arts, detective techniques, and criminal
			psychology.
			Dressing as a bat to prey on criminals' fears, Batman fights crimes
			with the aid of specialized gadgets and vehicles, operating out of his
			secret Batcave below Wayne Manor.
